Interview Basic Topic:
What is component?
Component is nothing but a function 
In reactjs component will return jsx 
jsx - javascript xml 
Each and every component will render jsx to display the output in original DOM.

Types of Component?
In Reacts we can write the component in two ways.
(i)functional component 
(ii)class component 

=======================================================
What is Class component 
//By using ES6 class concept we can implement this approach
//It consists of constructor method to initialize state data 
//It consists of render method to render jsx output to original dom 
//Class component will extends to react.component 
//render method is mandatory to render the data.

What is props?
//props is nothing but an custom attribute to custom components.
//By using props we can pass data from parent component to nested child component.
//To use props in class component we need to use variable name called props.

what is State?
state is nothing but a data or information store in some variable.
In reactjs state play important role because whenever we have dynamic data the react will not render again the jsx.
To make react know that we need to render jsx again we need to store dynamic data inside the state.
Whenever there is state changes happens react will trigger the jsx to re-render again.

To use state in react we need to use the variable called state to initialize the data.
To update the state in reactjs application we need to use setState to update any data.
state variable should be always be an object.
Example


class App extends React.Component{
	
    constructor(props){
          super(props);
          this.state={
            counter:0
          };
    }

    getCounterHandler=()=>{
         this.setState({
         counter:this.state.counter+1
         });
    }

    render(){
        return (<>
          {this.state.counter}
          <button onClick={this.getCounterHandler}>click</btton>
        </>)
    }


}
