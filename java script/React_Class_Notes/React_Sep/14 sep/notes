Notes:
Frontend Development:HTML,CSS,Javascript
Reactjs:
//It is an library(like student not find a solution in book so go to liberay like this)
//Reactjs is a SPA (Single page application)
//Only one html file will be present inside the reactjs application
//only section will get change in that particular page.
//=> Multipal page application(html & css & js every time render)
Example:gmail.com(SPA)

'

Single Page application other examples:
1.Reactjs
2.Angular
3.Vuejs 
=================================
Declarative:
1.we cannot see the inner lying only wrapper will be present
Component based:
1.function is called component in reactjs
   //why componant because of reuse(like filpkart)
example:
function name(){
	
}
2.component based help us to reuse the code.
3.always we need to divide our entire application into many number of 
components.
example:
1.button 
2.anchor tag 
3.search box
4.filter 
=======================================================
Reactjs is a combination of html ,css and javascript
=====================================================
Benefits:
1.SPA
2.component based - code reuse
3.code maintainable
4.virtual dom
5.More of functional programming
6.optimization (lazy loading,useMemo,usecallback,suspense)
7.unit testing setup
8.production build setup
==============================
Virtual DOM
//copy of real dom in the memory - reconciliation
//entire application first it will interact with virtual dom
//virtual dom will interact real dom
//To keep track of each similar data react will use unique key to identify them.
==================================================
Reactjs and ReactNative:
1.Before learning reactnative we should have knowledge on reactjs 
2.reactivenative helps to build native apps for andriod and ios 
===========================================
To setup Reactjs we need to have nodejs in our system.
Project structure:
1.node_modules
2.package.json
3.package-lock.json
4.readme - documenation file
5.src - source code 
6.public - index.html
============================================
To run the react application:
1.right click on package.json 
2.cmd:npm start
=====================================
